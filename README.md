T-REX is an algorithm developed in R for machine learning.  The T-REX acronym stands for Tracking Responders Expanding.  

T-REX takes as input two flow cytometry files that represent a pair of sampling times from one individual person.  As output, T-REX creates a UMAP analysis of an equal sampling of cells from the two files and then identifies hotspots of cells in phenotypic regions that are the most different between the two files.  

In the context of immune monitoring, the focus of T-REX on regions of great change between two sampling times can reveal disease-specific immune cells reacting to a virus.  T-REX has been tested on mass cytometry and spectral flow cytometry data from individuals with COVID-19, rhinovirus, melanoma, and leukemia.

#### Tracking Responders EXpanding (T-REX) algorithm identifies rare cells based on significant expansion or contraction during infection or treatment.
Graphic of the Tracking Responders Expanding (T-REX) workflow. Data from paired samples of blood from a subject are collected over the course of infection and analyzed by high dimensional, high cellularity cytometry approaches (e.g., Aurora or CyTOF instrument, as with datasets here). Cells from the sample pair are then equally subsampled for UMAP analysis. A KNN search is then performed within the UMAP manifold for every cell. For every cell, the percent change between the sample pairs is calculated for the cells within its KNN region. Regions of marked expansion or contraction during infection are then analyzed to identify cell types and key features using MEM. For some datasets, additional information not used in the analysis could be assessed to determine whether identified cells were virus-specific. Finally, the average direction and magnitude of change for cells in the sample was calculated as an overall summary of how the analyzed cells changed between samples.
